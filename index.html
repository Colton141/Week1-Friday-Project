        <h2>A Little About Me.</h2>
        <p>Curently a student at Epicodus, I live Vancouver Washington where I've spent my entire life. I'm in early 20s and when I'm not at Epicodus I spend my weekends working at the trucking company ABF. Before Epicodus bagan I had been working full time at ABF. Right after high shcool I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life. So I just started working, that's when I began working for ABF. After working there full time for almost 2 years I knew that ABF wasnt what I wanted to be doing forever, so I applied for a class at Epicodus.</p>

        <h4><strong>Why I Came To <span class="epicodus">Epicodus</span></strong></h4>
        <p>After getting out of high school I took time to fiqure out what kind of career I wanted. In that time I just began working and saving money. I have a friend that's a former student of Epicodus, so after some time and hearing about his job I decided this was a program that I was interested in. When sign up opened I applied to see what Epicodus would be like.</p>
